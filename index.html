            Nicknamed <em>The Greatest</em>, he is widely regarded as one of the
            most significant and celebrated sporting figures of the 20th
            century, and is frequently ranked as the best heavyweight boxer and

          <p>
            Muhammad Ali was a boxer, philanthropist and social activist who is
            universally regarded as one of the greatest athletes of the 20th
            century. Ali became an Olympic gold medalist in 1960 and the world
            heavyweight boxing champion in 1964. Following his suspension for
            refusing military service, Ali reclaimed the heavyweight title two
            more times during the 1970s, winning famed bouts against Joe Frazier
            and George Foreman along the way. Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease
            in 1984, Ali devoted much of his time to philanthropy, earning the
            Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005.

          <p id="caption">Early Life</p>
          <p>
            Ali was born on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky. His birth
            name was Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. At an early age, young Clay
            showed that he wasn't afraid of any bout â€” inside or outside of the
            ring. Growing up in the segregated South, he experienced racial
            prejudice and discrimination firsthand. <br />

            At the age of 12, Clay discovered his talent for boxing through an
            odd twist of fate. After his bike was stolen, Clay told a police
            officer, Joe Martin, that he wanted to beat up the thief. "Well, you
            better learn how to fight before you start challenging people,"
            Martin reportedly told him at the time. In addition to being a
            police officer, Martin also trained young boxers at a local gym.
            <br />

            Clay started working with Martin to learn how to spar and soon began
            his boxing career. In his first amateur bout in 1954, he won the
            fight by split decision. Clay went on to win the 1956 Golden Gloves
            tournament for novices in the light heavyweight class. Three years
            later, he won the National Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions, as
            well as the Amateur Athletic Union's national title for the light
            heavyweight division.

            Often referring to himself as <em>The Greatest</em>, Ali was not
            afraid to sing his own praises. He was known for boasting about his
            skills before a fight and for his colorful descriptions and phrases.
            <br />In one of his more famously quoted descriptions, Ali told
            reporters that he could "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"
            in the boxing ring. A few of his more well-known matches include the
